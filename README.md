# ARCHIVED
In favour of my (nearly) fully-featured custom [make system](https://github.com/SmartBoy84/DiyCompile)

### iOS-Makefiles
Custom makefiles for whatever programming language strikes my fancy

Currently contains makefiles for C and Golang

Note: while I have provided an option to pass flags to CC linker, try instead to use the golang solution:
E.g., 
```
//#cgo CFLAGS: -x objective-c
//#cgo LDFLAGS: -framework Foundation
//#include "foundation.h"
```

** VERY CUSTOM - NOT MEANT FOR UNINITIATED PUBLIC CONSUMPTION **
